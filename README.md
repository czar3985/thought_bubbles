# Thought Bubbles

A simple journal website server that serves up the Thought Bubbles site. 

The browser sends GET requests to the server that responds with the web page containing
a form for inputting thoughts and all previous inputs sorted from the most recent entry.

Upon receiving the POST request for a new input, the server fixes the current date and
time that corresponds to the entry before saving it to memory.
